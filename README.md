# Wind-Turbine-Airfoil-Design
This study uses Bezier-Generative Adversarial Networks to optimize airfoils for vertical axis wind turbines. By analyzing UIUC database features, it creates a novel airfoil library to maximize power coefficients. Airfoil No. 3 achieves the highest power coefficient of 0.393, enhancing turbine efficiency at rated conditions.
